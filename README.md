# SAS
This is about how I start to learn SAS step by step, from basic query and exporlation to complex statistics.
The hard parts are followings:
1.what methods should be applied for specific questions?
2.how to interpret results
3.based on complicated question(panel data, time series and cross sections data), how to come up with informative questions
